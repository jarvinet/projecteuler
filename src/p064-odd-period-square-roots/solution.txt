Turns out this is by far the best algorithm (out of those I have thought of)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Algorithm
The algorithm is simple and fast. It calculates the continued fraction and stops when
the period is finished so there is no need for a separate search for the period.
This is what has been done in p064.js continuedFraction2


for each k <= 10000
    calculate the continued fraction of k
    find the repeating period in the continued fraction (Knuth-Pratt-Morris)
    get the period length mod2
    
kmp.js implementation of Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm to find out the period of a string.

period.js another algorith by me to find the string period.
